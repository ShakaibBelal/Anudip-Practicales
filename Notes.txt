Code maintainance?
-> Easier to manage 

What is inheritance?
-> Inheritance Is a mechanism in java by which 1 class aquires the properties and behaviours of another class . 

Why use Inheritance ?
-> I)  Reusability(Avoid duplication of code)
    II) Extencability(you can add new feature to a exsisting class.
 
Single Level Inheritance ?
->	1 Base Class,1 Extended Class.

What is polymorphism ?
 I)polymorphism is one of the core concept of oop.
 II)it allows object to take many forms.
 III) Poly means many ,and morph means forms. 

Types of polymorphism

I)Compliletime,
    its is alaso known as static binding and method overloading 
    complie time polymorphism is achieved by mehod overloading
    method resolution happened at compile time
    
    benifists of polymorphism:

Definition abstract class: It can not be instantiated. It contains both abstract and non abstract method.
Definition Interface: It specifies a set of methods a class must implements. Methods are abstract by default.

Implementation method of abstract class: It can have both implemented and abstract method.
Implementation method of interface : Method are abstract by default. for java 8+ it can have default and static method.

Inheritance:
i)Abstract class: Class can inherit from only 1 abstract class.
ii)Interface: A class can implement multiple interfaces

Access Modifiers: 

Abstract: Methods and properties can have any access modifiers.(Public, protected, private).
Interface: Method and properties are implicitly public.

Variables:
 Abstract: It can have member variables(Final, Non final, static, non-static 
 Interfaces: Variable are implicitly public static and final  
 
Final: In Java Final keyword is a modifier that can be used with variable, methods, classes and it has different meaning depending on the context.
